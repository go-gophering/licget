## Usage
`licget list`

`licget mit`

`licget mit >> LICENSE`

(Only `licget list` actually works and to say it "works" is a stretch ðŸ˜…)

## Todo

- [ ] Get licenes to actually return
- [ ] Do something with the metadata returned
- [ ] Implement `fzf.go` when `list` is called
- [ ] Setup less janky argparsing
